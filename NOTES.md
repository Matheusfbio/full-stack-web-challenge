## Planning and priorities

During the planning of the challenge, I started to plan what the backend would be like and decided to use express because it was something simple in a short time of use, I implemented unit tests to guarantee the reliability of the code, no wonder I focused more on the backend than on the frontend for the front end would be a maximum of 3 screens but I only implemented it on 2 screens due to time.

## Difficulties and implements faced

I only had a few obstacles with AWS Sam and that ended up making it difficult to deploy the application, as I had no experience with the tool, but I managed to develop it well, but unfortunately I was unable to deploy the application due to some documentation obstacles and my lack of experience with the tool
